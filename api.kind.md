# apiVersion:
This field specifies the version of the Kubernetes API used for the resource being defined.   
It's crucial for ensuring compatibility between your YAML file and the Kubernetes cluster. 

# kind:
This field defines the type of Kubernetes resource you are creating.

# Finding apiVersion and kind for specific resources

- Kubernetes Documentation: The official Kubernetes documentation provides comprehensive information on all available Kubernetes resources, including their apiVersion and kind. Refer to the documentation for the specific resource you want to create (e.g., Deployments, Services, Pods).
- Use kubectl api-resources - Below to find the API version for "Deployment
  ```bash
  kubectl api-resources | grep Deployment
  ```
- kubectl explain command: This command provides information about a specific Kubernetes resource, including its API version and kind.
  ```bash
  kubectl explain deployments
  ```
  This command will display detailed information about the Deployment resource, including its API version (apps/v1), kind (Deployment), and other relevant fields.
- Finding information from resource
  ```bash
  kubectl get <resource> -o yaml
  ```
  This command retrieves an existing resource from the cluster and displays its YAML representation. This can be helpful in understanding the structure and available fields for a particular resource type.
